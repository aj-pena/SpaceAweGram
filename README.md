## Description

This REACT.js application allows the keen space observer to view images from the NASA Video and Image Library. By typing a keyword, the aplication will fetch all related images and display them in cards. The user will be able to like or unlike the images. Currently, no data permanence is implemented. In the future, a possible improvement would be to save liked images into a personal library so that the user can access them easily.

The USER STORY goes as follow

    AS A user
    I WANT an application that will fetch NASA images
    SO THAT I can view them and like them.  

## Installation

In the future, a 'Favourites' section will be developed, where liked images will be displayed and saved. For now, an "In Construction" warning sign is displayed.
